# Welcome!

This is the documentation for the SynthApp project, where the 
inner workings of the code behind the app are carefully laid out.
I may also use this space to put comprehensive tutorials on how
to use the app once it is finished, but that is unlikely: It's
better to have a self-explanatory UI.
